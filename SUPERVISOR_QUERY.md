# Supervisor Query: Project Setup Tasks

I have identified that the 'project_setup' group is empty, while setup-related todos exist in 'repo_setup' and 'project_bootstrap'.

**Questions:**
1. Should I complete the setup tasks under 'repo_setup' and 'project_bootstrap' as part of my devops responsibilities, or will 'project_setup' be populated with specific tasks?
2. Is there a preferred directory structure or any special requirements for the initial commit, virtual environment, and CI configuration?
3. Should I coordinate with the game_dev and qa_engineer agents regarding dependencies and CI integration at this stage, or wait for further instructions?

Please advise on how to proceed so I can fulfill my devops responsibilities efficiently.
