# Project Tasks

## Core Calculator Logic & Testing
- [ ] Implement Calculator class with basic arithmetic operations
  - Create the Calculator class with methods for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Include proper error handling for divide-by-zero and invalid operations. Ensure IEEE-754 double precision with rounding to 10 decimal places for display.
- [ ] Implement memory functions (M+, M-, MR, MC)
  - Add memory storage and recall functionality to the Calculator class. Include methods: memory_add(), memory_sub(), memory_recall(), and memory_clear() with proper state management.
- [ ] Create comprehensive unit tests for Calculator class
  - Write unit tests using Python's unittest framework to achieve ≥90% coverage. Test all arithmetic operations, edge cases, divide-by-zero scenarios, memory functions, and decimal precision handling.
- [ ] Implement state management and input validation
  - Build the state machine for handling calculator input flow (start → operand1 → operator → operand2 → result). Include validation for numeric input, operator precedence, and error recovery.

## GUI Development & User Interface
- [ ] Create basic Tkinter window and layout structure
  - Set up the main application window with proper sizing, title, and 4×5 grid layout for calculator buttons. Configure the window to be cross-platform compatible and ensure proper resizing behavior.
- [ ] Implement calculator display and button widgets (can work in parallel)
  - Create the single-line text display field (right-aligned, 20 chars max) and all required buttons (digits 0-9, operators +, -, *, /, clear C, equals =). Configure font size 14pt minimum and high-contrast color scheme for accessibility.
- [ ] Wire GUI events to Calculator model
  - Connect button click events and keyboard input to the Calculator class methods. Implement proper event handling for mouse clicks and keyboard shortcuts, ensuring the display updates automatically via StringVar.
- [ ] Add keyboard input support and accessibility features (can work in parallel)
  - Implement keyboard bindings for number keys (0-9), operators (+, -, *, /), Enter (=), and Esc (clear). Ensure accessibility compliance with proper tab order, keyboard navigation, and screen reader compatibility.

## Build & Packaging
- [ ] Create PyInstaller build configuration
  - Set up PyInstaller configuration files and build scripts for creating single executables for Windows, macOS, and Linux. Include proper icon files (.ico, .icns, .png) and ensure executable size stays under 15MB per platform.
- [ ] Set up GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline (can work in parallel)
  - Create GitHub Actions workflow for automated testing (unittest with coverage report) and cross-platform builds. Configure the pipeline to run on push/PR and generate release artifacts.
- [ ] Create distribution packages for all platforms
  - Generate final executable files for Windows 11, macOS 14, and Ubuntu 22.04 using the build scripts. Verify each executable runs correctly and meets the size requirements.
- [ ] Create release documentation and README (can work in parallel)
  - Write comprehensive README.md with installation instructions, usage guide, keyboard shortcuts, and troubleshooting. Include screenshots and platform-specific notes.

## Quality Assurance & Testing
- [ ] Perform manual QA testing on all platforms
  - Execute the manual QA checklist on Windows 11, macOS 14, and Ubuntu 22.04. Test all functional requirements FR-1 through FR-8, keyboard shortcuts, divide-by-zero handling, and error recovery scenarios.
- [ ] Conduct user acceptance testing (can work in parallel)
  - Recruit 3 non-technical users to perform 10 random calculations each without instruction. Document any usability issues and ensure all users can complete tasks within 2 minutes.
- [ ] Validate performance requirements (can work in parallel)
  - Test startup time (< 1 second) and calculation performance (< 100ms) on 2020-era hardware. Document results and optimize if necessary to meet performance criteria.
- [ ] Create final release and tag v1.0
  - Tag the repository with v1.0 release, create GitHub release page with binary attachments, and ensure all deliverables are properly documented and accessible.
