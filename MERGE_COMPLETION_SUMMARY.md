- [x] Added convenience functions: `create_single_agent`, `create_multi_orchestrator`, etc.
- [x] Built unified CLI with subcommands: `single`, `multi`, `tui`, `api`, `tools`
- [x] Updated console scripts and entry points

### Phase 6 – Config, Docs, CI ✓
- [x] Consolidated YAML configurations

### Phase 7 – Testing & QA ✓
- [x] Fixed import issues and method signatures
- [x] Created comprehensive test suite (`test_basic_functionality.py`)
- [x] Verified all core functionality works correctly
- [x] Manual testing of agent creation, orchestration, and tool usage

### Phase 8 – Cleanup & Release ✓
- [x] Committed all changes with proper git history
- [x] Tagged completion commits
- [x] Package ready for release as `v1.0.0`

│   └── worker_agent.py    # Restricted access + security features
├── orchestrators/
│   ├── single_orchestrator.py   # SimpleAgent wrapper
│   └── multi_agent_orchestrator.py  # Advanced coordination
├── tools/
│   ├── base.py            # Tool interface

└── cli/                  # Unified command interface
```

### Key Architectural Improvements

1. **Modular Agent System** [[memory:301674]](Taking user preference for concise, minimal code into account)
   - `BaseAgent`: Core functionality without bloat
   - `WorkerAgent`: Adds only necessary restrictions
   - Clean inheritance hierarchy

2. **Unified Orchestrators**
   - `SingleAgentOrchestrator`: Simple wrapper for basic tasks
   - `MultiAgentOrchestrator`: Advanced coordination with supervisor support
   - Consistent async API throughout

3. **Enhanced Security**
   - `RestrictedFileSystem`: Path traversal protection
   - Tool whitelisting per worker
   - Scope-based access controls

4. **Clean Public API**
   - Convenience functions for common use cases
   - Consistent naming conventions
   - Comprehensive type hints

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### Single Agent (Simple)
```python
from equitrcoder import create_single_orchestrator

orchestrator = create_single_orchestrator(max_cost=1.0)
result = await orchestrator.execute_task("Fix the bug in main.py")
```

### Multi-Agent (Advanced)
```python
from equitrcoder import create_multi_orchestrator, WorkerConfig

orchestrator = create_multi_orchestrator()
config = WorkerConfig("worker1", ["src/"], ["read_file", "edit_file"])
worker = orchestrator.create_worker(config)
result = await orchestrator.execute_task("task1", "worker1", "Refactor module")
```

### CLI Usage
```bash
# Single agent mode
equitrcoder single "Add error handling to login function"

# Multi-agent mode
equitrcoder multi "Implement authentication system" --workers 3

# Interactive TUI
equitrcoder tui --mode single
```
