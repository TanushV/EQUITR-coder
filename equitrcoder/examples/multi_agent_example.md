# Multi-Agent Mode Example

This example demonstrates how to use EQUITR Coder's multi-agent mode for complex projects.

## When to Use Multi-Agent Mode

Multi-agent mode is ideal for:
- **Complex System Architecture**: Multiple interconnected components
- **Microservices**: Independent services that need coordination
- **Parallel Development**: Components that can be built simultaneously
- **Large Projects**: Projects with many independent modules

## Example: E-commerce Platform

Let's build a complete e-commerce platform with multi-agent coordination.

### 1. Start Multi-Agent Mode
```bash
equitrcoder --multi-agent --repo ./ecommerce-platform
```

### 2. Initial Planning Conversation
```
What would you like to build?
> I want to create a complete e-commerce platform with microservices architecture

ðŸ¤– EQUITR Coder: What microservices do you envision for the platform?
> User management, product catalog, shopping cart, payment processing, order management, and inventory tracking

ðŸ¤– EQUITR Coder: What technology stack would you prefer?
> Python with FastAPI for backend services, React for frontend, PostgreSQL for databases, Redis for caching, and Docker for containerization

ðŸ¤– EQUITR Coder: How should the services communicate?
> REST APIs between services and message queues (RabbitMQ) for async operations

ðŸ¤– EQUITR Coder: What about authentication and authorization?
> JWT tokens with OAuth2, centralized auth service, and role-based access control

ðŸ¤– EQUITR Coder: Any specific deployment requirements?
> Kubernetes deployment with Helm charts, environment-based configuration, and monitoring setup

âœ… Planning conversation complete!

## Multi-Agent Coordination Features

### 1. Parallel Execution
- Multiple worker agents handle different services simultaneously
- Tasks are executed in parallel when dependencies allow
- Significant time savings for complex projects

### 2. Inter-Agent Communication
- Agents share information about interfaces and contracts
- Coordination messages ensure compatibility
- Shared context prevents conflicts

### 3. Dependency Management
- Supervisor tracks task dependencies
- Ensures prerequisite tasks complete before dependent tasks start
- Handles complex dependency graphs automatically

### 4. Error Handling and Recovery
- If one agent fails, others continue with independent tasks
- Failed tasks are retried or escalated to supervisor
- Comprehensive error reporting and recovery strategies

## Benefits of Multi-Agent Mode

### 1. **Speed**: Parallel execution reduces overall development time
### 2. **Quality**: Specialized agents focus on specific areas of expertise
### 3. **Coordination**: Supervisor ensures architectural consistency
### 4. **Scalability**: Can handle very large, complex projects
### 5. **Reliability**: Fault tolerance and error recovery

## Best Practices for Multi-Agent Mode

### 1. Use for Complex Projects
- Multiple independent components
- Microservices architectures
- Large-scale applications

### 2. Provide Clear Requirements
- Detailed planning conversations
- Specific technology preferences
- Clear architectural decisions

### 3. Review Generated Documentation
- Verify service boundaries
- Check integration points
- Ensure comprehensive coverage

### 4. Monitor Agent Communication
- Watch for coordination messages
- Verify dependency resolution
- Check for integration issues

## Configuration for Multi-Agent Mode

```yaml
# ~/.equitr/config.yaml
orchestrator:
  use_multi_agent: true
  max_iterations: 30
  worker_timeout: 600
  max_workers: 5

llm:
  model: "gpt-4o"  # More powerful model for complex coordination
  budget: 100.0    # Higher budget for multi-agent projects
  temperature: 0.2 # Lower temperature for consistent architecture
```

Multi-agent mode transforms EQUITR Coder into a powerful orchestrator capable of handling enterprise-scale projects with the coordination and efficiency of a complete development team.
