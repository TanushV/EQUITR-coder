# Calculator Project Requirements

## Project Overview
A Python-based calculator application with a command-line interface.

## Functional Requirements
1. Basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
2. Error handling for invalid inputs and division by zero
3. Command-line interface for user interaction
4. Clear and intuitive user experience

## Non-Functional Requirements
1. Code should be well-documented and maintainable
2. Include comprehensive unit tests
3. Follow Python best practices and PEP 8 style guide
4. Handle edge cases gracefully

## Acceptance Criteria
- Calculator performs all basic operations correctly
- Invalid inputs are handled with appropriate error messages
- Division by zero returns a meaningful error message
- All functions have corresponding unit tests
- Code coverage should be at least 80%
