# Requirements Document for Python Calculator Application

## 1. PROJECT OVERVIEW

### Brief Description
The project involves developing a simple Python-based calculator application that performs basic arithmetic operations. The application will feature a command-line interface (CLI) and include error handling and unit tests to ensure reliability and correctness.

### Main Objectives and Goals
- Develop a modular calculator application with a clean and intuitive command-line interface.
- Implement basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Ensure robust error handling, particularly for division by zero.
- Create unit tests to validate the functionality and reliability of the application.

## 2. FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

### Core Features and Functionality
- **Arithmetic Operations**: The calculator should support the following operations:
  - Addition
  - Subtraction
  - Multiplication
  - Division
- **Error Handling**: The application should handle errors gracefully, especially:
  - Division by zero
  - Invalid input types
- **Command-Line Interface (CLI)**: Users should be able to interact with the calculator via a command-line interface.

### User Stories or Use Cases
- **As a user**, I want to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division so that I can calculate results for basic arithmetic problems.
- **As a user**, I want the application to notify me if I attempt to divide by zero so that I understand why the operation failed.
- **As a user**, I want to receive clear error messages for invalid inputs so that I can correct my input and try again.

### Input/Output Specifications
- **Input**: The application should accept two numeric operands and an operator (+, -, *, /) from the command line.
- **Output**: The application should display the result of the operation or an error message if applicable.

## 3. NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

### Performance Requirements
- The calculator should perform operations and return results within a second for typical inputs.

### Security Considerations
- The application should validate user inputs to prevent execution of unintended operations.

### Scalability Needs
- The application is intended for single-user use and does not require scalability for concurrent users.

### Compatibility Requirements
- The application should be compatible with Python 3.x and run on major operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux).

## 4. TECHNICAL CONSTRAINTS

### Technology Stack Preferences
- **Programming Language**: Python 3.x
- **Testing Framework**: unittest or pytest for unit testing

### Platform Requirements
- The application should run on any system with Python 3.x installed.

### Dependencies and Integrations
- No external libraries are required beyond Python's standard library.

## 5. ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA

### Success Metrics
- The application correctly performs all specified arithmetic operations.
- The application handles division by zero and invalid inputs gracefully.
- The CLI is user-friendly and intuitive.

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests should cover all arithmetic operations and error handling scenarios.
- Tests should achieve at least 90% code coverage.

### Quality Standards
- Code should adhere to PEP 8 guidelines for Python code style.
- The application should be documented with comments and a user guide for CLI usage.
