Here is a detailed todo list for the Python Calculator Application project:

### 1. SETUP TASKS

1. **Project Initialization**
   - [ ] Create a new directory for the project. *(Priority: High, Complexity: Simple)*
   - [ ] Initialize a Git repository. *(Priority: High, Complexity: Simple)*

2. **Environment Setup**
   - [ ] Ensure Python 3.x is installed on the development machine. *(Priority: High, Complexity: Simple)*
   - [ ] Set up a virtual environment for the project. *(Priority: High, Complexity: Simple)*

3. **Dependencies Installation**
   - [ ] Install any necessary packages (e.g., `unittest` is part of the standard library, so no external installation required). *(Priority: Medium, Complexity: Simple)*

### 2. CORE IMPLEMENTATION TASKS

1. **Calculator Core**
   - [ ] Implement the addition function. *(Priority: High, Complexity: Simple)*
   - [ ] Implement the subtraction function. *(Priority: High, Complexity: Simple)*
   - [ ] Implement the multiplication function. *(Priority: High, Complexity: Simple)*
   - [ ] Implement the division function with division by zero handling. *(Priority: High, Complexity: Medium)*

2. **Error Handling**
   - [ ] Develop input validation functions to ensure correct operand types and valid operators. *(Priority: High, Complexity: Medium)*
   - [ ] Implement exception handling for division by zero and invalid inputs. *(Priority: High, Complexity: Medium)*

3. **Command-Line Interface (CLI)**
   - [ ] Design the CLI to accept user input for operands and operator. *(Priority: High, Complexity: Medium)*
   - [ ] Implement functionality to display results or error messages. *(Priority: High, Complexity: Medium)*

### 3. TESTING TASKS

1. **Unit Test Creation**
   - [ ] Write unit tests for the addition function. *(Priority: High, Complexity: Medium)*
   - [ ] Write unit tests for the subtraction function. *(Priority: High, Complexity: Medium)*
   - [ ] Write unit tests for the multiplication function. *(Priority: High, Complexity: Medium)*
   - [ ] Write unit tests for the division function, including division by zero scenarios. *(Priority: High, Complexity: Medium)*

2. **Integration Test Setup**
   - [ ] Develop integration tests to verify interaction between CLI, calculator core, and error handling. *(Priority: Medium, Complexity: Medium)*

3. **Test Data Preparation**
   - [ ] Prepare a set of test cases covering valid and invalid inputs. *(Priority: Medium, Complexity: Simple)*

### 4. DOCUMENTATION TASKS

1. **Code Documentation**
   - [ ] Add comments and docstrings to all functions and modules. *(Priority: Medium, Complexity: Simple)*

2. **User Documentation**
   - [ ] Write a README file with setup instructions and usage guide for the CLI. *(Priority: High, Complexity: Medium)*

3. **API Documentation**
   - [ ] Document the public interfaces of the calculator core and CLI modules. *(Priority: Low, Complexity: Simple)*

### 5. DEPLOYMENT TASKS

1. **Configuration Setup**
   - [ ] Ensure the virtual environment is correctly configured for deployment. *(Priority: Medium, Complexity: Simple)*

2. **Deployment Preparation**
   - [ ] Prepare the project for local deployment by ensuring all files are correctly organized and documented. *(Priority: Medium, Complexity: Simple)*

3. **Production Readiness Checks**
   - [ ] Verify that all tests pass with at least 90% code coverage. *(Priority: High, Complexity: Medium)*
   - [ ] Conduct a final review of the code for adherence to PEP 8 standards. *(Priority: Medium, Complexity: Simple)*

This todo list provides a structured approach to developing the Python Calculator Application, ensuring all aspects of the project are covered from setup to deployment.
