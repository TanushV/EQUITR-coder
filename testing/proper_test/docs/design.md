# Design Document for Python Calculator Application

## 1. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

### High-Level Architecture Overview
The Python Calculator Application is designed as a command-line interface (CLI) tool that performs basic arithmetic operations. The architecture is modular, with separate components for the core calculator logic, error handling, and user interface. This separation ensures maintainability and ease of testing.

### Component Breakdown
- **Calculator Core**: Handles arithmetic operations.
- **Error Handling**: Manages exceptions and user input validation.
- **Command-Line Interface (CLI)**: Facilitates user interaction.

### Data Flow Diagrams (Described in Text)
1. **User Input**: The user provides two operands and an operator via the CLI.
2. **Input Validation**: The input is validated for correctness (e.g., numeric operands, valid operator).
3. **Operation Execution**: The calculator core performs the requested operation.
4. **Error Handling**: Any errors (e.g., division by zero) are caught and managed.
5. **Output**: The result or error message is displayed to the user via the CLI.

## 2. TECHNICAL DESIGN

### Technology Stack Selection and Rationale
- **Programming Language**: Python 3.x is chosen for its simplicity, readability, and extensive standard library, which is sufficient for the application's needs.
- **Testing Framework**: `unittest` is selected for its integration with Python and ease of use for writing and running tests.

## 3. COMPONENT SPECIFICATIONS

### Individual Component Descriptions

#### Calculator Core
- **Functionality**: Performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Interfaces**: Exposes functions for each arithmetic operation.
- **Data Structures**: Uses basic numeric types (int, float).

#### Error Handling
- **Functionality**: Catches and manages exceptions, validates inputs.
- **Interfaces**: Provides functions to check input validity and handle exceptions.
- **Data Structures**: Utilizes Python's exception handling mechanism.

#### Command-Line Interface (CLI)
- **Functionality**: Manages user interaction and input/output.
- **Interfaces**: Reads user input, displays results or error messages.
- **Data Structures**: Uses strings for input/output.

## 4. IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY

### Development Phases
1. **Phase 1**: Develop the core calculator logic.
2. **Phase 2**: Implement error handling.
3. **Phase 3**: Develop the CLI.
4. **Phase 4**: Write unit tests for all components.

### Priority Order of Components
1. Calculator Core
2. Error Handling
3. CLI
4. Unit Tests

### Risk Mitigation Strategies
- **Testing**: Comprehensive unit tests to catch errors early.
- **Modular Design**: Allows isolated development and testing of components.

## 5. TESTING STRATEGY

### Unit Testing Approach
- **Coverage**: Test all arithmetic operations and error scenarios.
- **Tools**: Use `unittest` to create and run tests.

### Integration Testing Plan
- **Focus**: Ensure seamless interaction between CLI, calculator core, and error handling.
- **Approach**: Simulate user inputs and verify outputs.

### Testing Tools and Frameworks
- **Framework**: `unittest` for unit and integration tests.

## 6. DEPLOYMENT CONSIDERATIONS

### Environment Requirements
- Python 3.x installed on the target system.

### Configuration Management
- Use a version control system (e.g., Git) to manage code changes.

### Deployment Strategy
- **Local Deployment**: Users can clone the repository and run the application locally.
- **Documentation**: Provide a README file with instructions for setup and usage.

This design document provides a comprehensive overview of the Python Calculator Application, outlining the architecture, technical design, component specifications, implementation strategy, testing strategy, and deployment considerations. This structured approach ensures a robust and maintainable application.
