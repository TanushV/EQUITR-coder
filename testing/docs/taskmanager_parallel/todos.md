# Project Tasks

## Backend Infrastructure & Database
- [ ] Set up PostgreSQL database with Docker
  - Create Docker configuration for PostgreSQL 15.4 with proper environment variables, volume mounts, and health checks. Include initial database setup and user creation.
- [ ] Create database schema and migrations
  - Implement the complete database schema including users, tasks, and comments tables with proper indexes, constraints, and relationships. Create migration files for version control.

  - Configure Redis 7.2 with Docker for session storage and query caching. Implement connection pooling and basic cache invalidation strategies.
- [ ] Implement database connection and models (can work in parallel)
  - Create database connection utilities using pg library, implement TypeScript models for User, Task, and Comment entities with proper type definitions and validation.
- [ ] Create seed data scripts (can work in parallel)
  - Develop database seeding scripts with realistic test data for users, tasks, and comments to facilitate development and testing.

## Authentication & User Management
- [ ] Implement JWT authentication middleware
  - Create JWT token generation and validation utilities with 24-hour expiration. Implement middleware for protecting routes and extracting user context from tokens.
- [ ] Build user registration endpoint (can work in parallel)
  - Create POST /api/auth/register endpoint with input validation, password hashing using bcrypt, email uniqueness checks, and proper error handling.
- [ ] Build user login endpoint (can work in parallel)
  - Create POST /api/auth/login endpoint with credential validation, JWT token generation, and session management using Redis store.
- [ ] Implement user profile endpoints (can work in parallel)
  - Create GET and PUT /api/users/profile endpoints for retrieving and updating user information with proper authorization checks.
- [ ] Add logout and session management (can work in parallel)
  - Implement POST /api/auth/logout endpoint to invalidate JWT tokens and clear Redis sessions. Add automatic session cleanup.

## Task Management API
- [ ] Create task CRUD endpoints
  - Implement POST, PUT, DELETE /api/tasks endpoints with full CRUD operations, input validation, and authorization checks to ensure users can only modify their own tasks.
- [ ] Implement task listing with filtering (can work in parallel)
  - Create GET /api/tasks endpoint with query parameter support for filtering by status, priority, assignee, tags, due date, and sorting by various fields with pagination.
- [ ] Build task assignment system (can work in parallel)
  - Implement task assignment functionality allowing task creators to assign tasks to other users, including validation for existing users and permission checks.
- [ ] Add full-text search capability (can work in parallel)
  - Implement PostgreSQL full-text search across task titles, descriptions, and comments with proper indexing and relevance scoring.
- [ ] Create task sharing endpoint (can work in parallel)
  - Build POST /api/tasks/:id/share endpoint for sharing tasks via email, including email validation and notification system integration.

## Comments & Notifications
- [ ] Implement comment system
  - Create POST /api/tasks/:id/comments endpoint for adding comments to tasks, including input validation, user authorization, and proper association with tasks.
- [ ] Build email notification service (can work in parallel)
  - Integrate SendGrid API for sending email notifications, create email templates for task assignments and new comments, implement queue system for async email delivery.
- [ ] Create notification queue system (can work in parallel)
  - Set up Redis-based job queue using pg-boss for processing email notifications asynchronously with retry logic and failure handling.
- [ ] Implement real-time comment updates (can work in parallel)
  - Add WebSocket support for real-time comment updates using Socket.io, including connection management and event broadcasting to relevant users.

## Frontend React Application
- [ ] Set up React TypeScript project
  - Initialize React 18.2 project with TypeScript 5.0, Vite 4.4, configure ESLint, Prettier, and essential development dependencies including React Router and React Query.
- [ ] Create authentication UI components (can work in parallel)
  - Build login and registration forms with validation, protected route components, and authentication state management using Zustand store.
- [ ] Implement task management UI (can work in parallel)
  - Create task list view with filtering and sorting, task creation/editing forms, task cards with status indicators, and responsive design for mobile and desktop.
- [ ] Build dashboard components (can work in parallel)
  - Create dashboard with summary statistics (total tasks, completed today, overdue), quick add task functionality, and recent activity feed with real-time updates.
- [ ] Add comments and collaboration UI (can work in parallel)
  - Implement comment threads on task detail view, user assignment interface, task sharing modal, and notification indicators for new comments/assignments.

## DevOps & Deployment
- [ ] Create Docker containerization
  - Write Dockerfiles for frontend, backend, and nginx reverse proxy. Create docker-compose.yml for local development with proper networking and volume mounts.
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline (can work in parallel)
  - Configure GitHub Actions workflows for continuous integration (testing, linting) and deployment to staging/production environments with automated Docker builds.
- [ ] Implement security hardening (can work in parallel)
  - Add rate limiting middleware (100 req/min per IP), input validation on all endpoints, SQL injection prevention, HTTPS configuration, and security headers.
- [ ] Create production deployment setup (can work in parallel)
  - Set up production docker-compose configuration with environment variables, health check endpoints, logging configuration, and nginx reverse proxy with SSL termination.
- [ ] Add monitoring and documentation (can work in parallel)
  - Create comprehensive API documentation, user guide with screenshots, README with setup instructions, and implement health check endpoint at /health for monitoring.
