# Design Document for 'hello.py' Script

## 1. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

### High-level Architecture Overview
The `hello.py` script is a simple standalone Python application designed to perform two main tasks: print a message to the console and write the same message to a text file. The architecture is straightforward, consisting of a single script file with no external dependencies.

### Component Breakdown
- **Console Output Component**: Responsible for printing "Hello, World!" to the console.
- **File Output Component**: Responsible for creating and writing "Hello, World!" to `output.txt`.

### Data Flow Diagrams (Described in Text)
1. **Console Output Flow**: 
   - The script starts execution.
   - The console output component prints "Hello, World!" to the console.

2. **File Output Flow**:
   - The script checks if `output.txt` exists in the current directory.
   - The file output component writes "Hello, World!" to `output.txt`.

## 2. TECHNICAL DESIGN

### Technology Stack Selection and Rationale
- **Python 3.x**: Chosen for its simplicity, readability, and widespread use in educational settings. It is suitable for demonstrating basic programming concepts such as console output and file I/O.

### File Structure and Organization
- **hello.py**: The main script file containing all the logic for console and file output.

## 3. COMPONENT SPECIFICATIONS

### Individual Component Descriptions

#### Console Output Component
- **Functionality**: Prints "Hello, World!" to the console.
- **Implementation**: Utilizes Python's built-in `print()` function.

#### File Output Component
- **Functionality**: Creates a file named `output.txt` and writes "Hello, World!" to it.
- **Implementation**: Uses Python's built-in `open()` function with write mode.

### Interfaces and Interactions
- The two components interact sequentially within the script. The console output occurs first, followed by the file output.

### Data Structures and Models
- No complex data structures are used. The message "Hello, World!" is a simple string.

## 4. IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY

### Development Phases
1. **Phase 1**: Implement console output functionality.
2. **Phase 2**: Implement file output functionality.

### Priority Order of Components
- The console output component is prioritized first to ensure immediate feedback when the script runs.

### Risk Mitigation Strategies
- Ensure compatibility with Python 3.x by testing on multiple platforms.
- Handle file I/O operations carefully to avoid exceptions (e.g., using `with` statement for file handling).

## 5. TESTING STRATEGY

### Unit Testing Approach
- Since the script is simple, manual testing will suffice. Verify that the console output is correct and that the file `output.txt` is created with the correct content.

### Integration Testing Plan
- No integration testing is needed due to the script's standalone nature.

### Testing Tools and Frameworks
- Manual testing using a terminal or command prompt.

## 6. DEPLOYMENT CONSIDERATIONS

### Environment Requirements
- Python 3.x must be installed on the system.
- The script should be executed in an environment where the user has write permissions to the current directory.

### Configuration Management
- No specific configuration management is required due to the simplicity of the script.

### Deployment Strategy
- The script can be deployed by simply copying `hello.py` to the target environment and executing it using Python 3.x.

This design document outlines the simple yet comprehensive plan for implementing the `hello.py` script, ensuring clarity in its functionality and ease of use for educational purposes.
