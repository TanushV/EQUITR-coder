# Design Document for `hello.py` Script

## 1. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

### High-level Architecture Overview
The `hello.py` script is a standalone Python application designed to perform two simple tasks: print a message to the console and write the same message to a text file. This script does not interact with any external systems or databases and operates entirely within the local file system.

### Component Breakdown
- **Console Output Component**: Responsible for printing "Hello, World!" to the console.
- **File Output Component**: Responsible for creating a file named `output.txt` and writing "Hello, World!" into it.

### Data Flow Diagrams (Described in Text)
1. **Start**: The script execution begins.
2. **Console Output**: The message "Hello, World!" is printed to the console.
3. **File Creation**: A file named `output.txt` is created in the script's directory.
4. **File Writing**: The message "Hello, World!" is written into `output.txt`.
5. **End**: The script completes execution.

## 2. TECHNICAL DESIGN

### Technology Stack Selection and Rationale
- **Programming Language**: Python 3.x is chosen due to its simplicity, readability, and widespread availability across platforms.

### File Structure and Organization
- The script consists of a single file:
  - `hello.py`: Contains the entire logic for printing to the console and writing to a file.

## 3. COMPONENT SPECIFICATIONS

### Individual Component Descriptions
- **Console Output Component**: Utilizes Python's built-in `print()` function to display the message on the console.
- **File Output Component**: Uses Python's built-in `open()` function in write mode to create and write to `output.txt`.

### Interfaces and Interactions
- The components interact with the Python runtime environment and the local file system. There are no external interfaces or APIs.

### Data Structures and Models
- No complex data structures or models are required. The message "Hello, World!" is a simple string.

## 4. IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY

### Development Phases
1. **Phase 1**: Implement the console output functionality.
2. **Phase 2**: Implement the file creation and writing functionality.

### Priority Order of Components
- The console output component is prioritized first, followed by the file output component.

### Risk Mitigation Strategies
- Ensure compatibility with Python 3.x to avoid version-related issues.
- Test the script on different operating systems to ensure cross-platform compatibility.

## 5. TESTING STRATEGY

### Unit Testing Approach
- Manually verify that the console output is correct by running the script and observing the output.
- Manually check that `output.txt` is created and contains the correct message.

### Integration Testing Plan
- Since the script is a standalone application, integration testing is not applicable.

### Testing Tools and Frameworks
- No external testing tools are required. Manual testing suffices for this simple script.

## 6. DEPLOYMENT CONSIDERATIONS

### Environment Requirements
- The script requires a Python 3.x environment to run.

### Configuration Management
- No configuration management is necessary due to the simplicity of the script.

### Deployment Strategy
- The script can be deployed by copying `hello.py` to any directory on a system with Python 3.x installed. Execution is performed via the command line or terminal.

By following this design document, the `hello.py` script will be implemented efficiently, meeting all specified requirements and objectives.
