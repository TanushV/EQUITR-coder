# Requirements Document for `hello.py` Script

## 1. PROJECT OVERVIEW

### Brief Description of the Project
The project involves creating a simple Python script named `hello.py`. This script is designed to perform two primary functions: print the message "Hello, World!" to the console and create a text file named `output.txt` containing the same message.

### Main Objectives and Goals
- Develop a Python script that outputs a standard greeting message.
- Ensure the script writes the greeting message to a text file for persistent storage.

## 2. FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

### Core Features and Functionality
- **Print Message**: The script must print "Hello, World!" to the console.
- **File Creation**: The script must create a file named `output.txt` and write "Hello, World!" into it.

### User Stories or Use Cases
- **As a user**, I want to run the `hello.py` script so that I can see the message "Hello, World!" printed on my console.
- **As a user**, I want the script to create a text file with the message "Hello, World!" so that I have a persistent record of the output.

### Input/Output Specifications
- **Input**: No user input is required; the script runs autonomously.
- **Output**: 
  - Console output: "Hello, World!"
  - File output: A text file named `output.txt` containing "Hello, World!"

## 3. NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

### Performance Requirements
- The script should execute and complete its tasks within a few milliseconds on a standard personal computer.

### Security Considerations
- The script should not perform any operations beyond printing to the console and writing to a file, minimizing security risks.

### Scalability Needs
- The script is intended for single-use execution and does not require scalability considerations.

### Compatibility Requirements
- The script should be compatible with Python 3.x environments.

## 4. TECHNICAL CONSTRAINTS

### Technology Stack Preferences
- **Programming Language**: Python 3.x

### Platform Requirements
- The script should be executable on any operating system that supports Python 3.x, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.

### Dependencies and Integrations
- There are no external dependencies or integrations required for this script.

## 5. ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA

### Success Metrics
- The script successfully prints "Hello, World!" to the console.
- The script successfully creates a file named `output.txt` with the content "Hello, World!".

### Testing Requirements
- Manual testing to verify console output and file creation.
- Ensure the script runs without errors on different operating systems with Python 3.x.

### Quality Standards
- The script should follow Python's PEP 8 style guide for code readability and maintainability.
- The script should be free of syntax and runtime errors.

By adhering to these requirements, the `hello.py` script will meet the specified objectives and function as intended.
