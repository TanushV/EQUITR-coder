# Requirements Document for 'hello.py' Script

## 1. PROJECT OVERVIEW

### Brief Description of the Project
The project involves creating a simple Python script named `hello.py`. This script will perform two primary functions: print the message "Hello, World!" to the console and create a text file named `output.txt` containing the same message.

### Main Objectives and Goals
- Develop a Python script to demonstrate basic file I/O operations.
- Ensure the script is easy to understand and execute.
- Provide a simple example of Python programming for educational purposes.

## 2. FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

### Core Features and Functionality
- The script should print "Hello, World!" to the console.
- The script should create a file named `output.txt` in the same directory as the script.
- The file `output.txt` should contain the text "Hello, World!".

### User Stories or Use Cases
- **As a user**, I want to execute the script and see "Hello, World!" printed on my console.
- **As a user**, I want the script to generate a text file named `output.txt` with the content "Hello, World!" so that I can verify the file creation functionality.

### Input/Output Specifications
- **Input**: No user input is required.
- **Output**: 
  - Console output: "Hello, World!"
  - File output: A file named `output.txt` containing "Hello, World!"

## 3. NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

### Performance Requirements
- The script should execute and complete its tasks within a few seconds on a standard personal computer.

### Security Considerations
- The script should not require any elevated permissions to run.
- The script should not expose any security vulnerabilities, such as writing to unauthorized directories.

### Scalability Needs
- The script is intended for educational purposes and does not need to scale.

### Compatibility Requirements
- The script should be compatible with Python 3.x.
- The script should run on major operating systems including Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## 4. TECHNICAL CONSTRAINTS

### Technology Stack Preferences
- The script must be written in Python.

### Platform Requirements
- The script should be platform-independent, running on any system with Python 3.x installed.

### Dependencies and Integrations
- No external libraries or dependencies are required beyond the standard Python library.

## 5. ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA

### Success Metrics
- The script prints "Hello, World!" to the console upon execution.
- The script creates a file named `output.txt` with the content "Hello, World!".

### Testing Requirements
- Manual testing to ensure the console output is correct.
- Verification that `output.txt` is created and contains the correct text.

### Quality Standards
- The script should be written in clean, readable Python code.
- The script should follow PEP 8 style guidelines for Python code.
