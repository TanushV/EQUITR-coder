# Requirements Document for 'hello.py' Project

## 1. PROJECT OVERVIEW

### Brief Description
The 'hello.py' project involves creating a simple Python script that outputs the message "Hello, World!" both to the console and to a text file named 'output.txt'.

### Main Objectives and Goals
- Develop a Python script that prints "Hello, World!" to the console.
- Ensure the script creates a text file named 'output.txt' containing the same message.
- Deliver a straightforward and efficient solution.

## 2. FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

### Core Features and Functionality
- The script should print "Hello, World!" to the console when executed.
- The script should create a file named 'output.txt' in the same directory as the script.
- The 'output.txt' file should contain the text "Hello, World!".

### User Stories or Use Cases
- **As a user**, I want to run the script and see "Hello, World!" printed on the console.
- **As a user**, I want the script to automatically generate a text file with the message "Hello, World!" so that I have a persistent record of the output.

### Input/Output Specifications
- **Input**: No user input is required.
- **Output**: 
  - Console: "Hello, World!"
  - File: 'output.txt' containing "Hello, World!"

## 3. NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

### Scalability Needs
- The script is intended for a single-user environment with no immediate scalability requirements.

### Compatibility Requirements
- The script should be compatible with Python 3.x.
- It should run on any operating system that supports Python 3.x, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## 4. TECHNICAL CONSTRAINTS

### Technology Stack Preferences
- The script must be written in Python.

### Platform Requirements
- The script should be platform-independent, running on any system with Python 3.x installed.

### Dependencies and Integrations
- No external libraries or dependencies are required for this script.

## 5. ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA

### Success Metrics
- The script successfully prints "Hello, World!" to the console.
- The script successfully creates 'output.txt' with the correct content.

### Testing Requirements
- Manual testing to ensure the console output is correct.
