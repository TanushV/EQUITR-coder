Here's a comprehensive todo list for the `hello.py` project, organized by category and priority:

### 1. SETUP TASKS

1. **Project Initialization**
   - [High] Create a new directory for the project and name it appropriately (e.g., `hello_project`).
   - [High] Inside the project directory, create a file named `hello.py`.

2. **Environment Setup**
   - [High] Ensure Python 3.x is installed on the development machine.
   - [Medium] Verify that the Python environment is correctly configured by running a simple Python script.

3. **Dependencies Installation**
   - [Low] Confirm that no external dependencies are needed for this project.

### 2. CORE IMPLEMENTATION TASKS

1. **Console Output Component**
   - [High] Implement the console output functionality in `hello.py` using Python's `print()` function. (Complexity: Simple)

2. **File Output Component**
   - [High] Implement the file creation functionality in `hello.py` using Python's `open()` function in write mode. (Complexity: Simple)
   - [High] Write the message "Hello, World!" into the file `output.txt`. (Complexity: Simple)

3. **Task Dependencies and Order**
   - [High] Complete the console output component before starting the file output component.

### 3. TESTING TASKS

1. **Unit Test Creation**
   - [Medium] Manually verify the console output by running `hello.py` and observing the output. (Complexity: Simple)
   - [Medium] Manually check that `output.txt` is created and contains the correct message. (Complexity: Simple)

2. **Integration Test Setup**
   - [Low] Since the script is standalone, integration testing is not applicable.

3. **Test Data Preparation**
   - [Low] No test data preparation is needed as the script does not take input.

### 4. DOCUMENTATION TASKS

1. **Code Documentation**
   - [Medium] Add comments in `hello.py` explaining the purpose of each major section of the code. (Complexity: Simple)

2. **User Documentation**
   - [Medium] Create a README file in the project directory with instructions on how to run the script. (Complexity: Simple)

3. **API Documentation**
   - [Low] Not applicable as there are no APIs involved.

### 5. DEPLOYMENT TASKS

1. **Configuration Setup**
   - [Low] No configuration setup is necessary due to the simplicity of the script.

2. **Deployment Preparation**
   - [Medium] Test the script on different operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux) to ensure compatibility. (Complexity: Medium)

3. **Production Readiness Checks**
   - [Medium] Ensure the script runs without errors and meets all acceptance criteria. (Complexity: Medium)

By following this detailed todo list, the `hello.py` script can be developed, tested, documented, and deployed efficiently, meeting all specified requirements and objectives.
