Here's a detailed to-do list based on the provided conversation, requirements, and design documents for the `hello.py` script:

### 1. SETUP TASKS

1. **Project Initialization**
   - [ ] Create a new directory for the project. *(Priority: High, Complexity: Simple)*
   - [ ] Initialize a version control system (e.g., Git) for the project. *(Priority: Medium, Complexity: Simple)*

2. **Environment Setup**
   - [ ] Ensure Python 3.x is installed on the development machine. *(Priority: High, Complexity: Simple)*
   - [ ] Verify write permissions in the current directory. *(Priority: High, Complexity: Simple)*

3. **Dependencies Installation**
   - [ ] Confirm that no external dependencies are needed beyond the standard Python library. *(Priority: High, Complexity: Simple)*

### 2. CORE IMPLEMENTATION TASKS

1. **Console Output Component**
   - [ ] Implement the functionality to print "Hello, World!" to the console using Python's `print()` function. *(Priority: High, Complexity: Simple)*

2. **File Output Component**
   - [ ] Implement the functionality to create a file named `output.txt` in the current directory. *(Priority: High, Complexity: Simple)*
   - [ ] Write "Hello, World!" to `output.txt` using Python's `open()` function with write mode. *(Priority: High, Complexity: Simple)*

3. **Task Order and Dependencies**
   - [ ] Ensure the console output functionality is implemented before the file output functionality to provide immediate feedback. *(Priority: High, Complexity: Simple)*

### 3. TESTING TASKS

1. **Manual Testing**
   - [ ] Execute the script to verify that "Hello, World!" is printed to the console. *(Priority: High, Complexity: Simple)*
   - [ ] Check that `output.txt` is created and contains "Hello, World!". *(Priority: High, Complexity: Simple)*

2. **Test Data Preparation**
   - [ ] Prepare a clean environment to test the script, ensuring no pre-existing `output.txt` file. *(Priority: Medium, Complexity: Simple)*

### 4. DOCUMENTATION TASKS

1. **Code Documentation**
   - [ ] Add inline comments to the script explaining each major step. *(Priority: Medium, Complexity: Simple)*

2. **User Documentation**
   - [ ] Create a README file with instructions on how to run the script. *(Priority: Medium, Complexity: Simple)*

3. **API Documentation**
   - [ ] Not applicable as there is no API involved. *(Priority: Low, Complexity: N/A)*

### 5. DEPLOYMENT TASKS

1. **Configuration Setup**
   - [ ] Ensure the script is configured to run in any environment with Python 3.x installed. *(Priority: High, Complexity: Simple)*

2. **Deployment Preparation**
   - [ ] Package the script for easy distribution (e.g., zip file or repository). *(Priority: Medium, Complexity: Simple)*

3. **Production Readiness Checks**
   - [ ] Verify that the script runs without errors on different operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux). *(Priority: High, Complexity: Medium)*

This to-do list provides a structured approach to implementing and deploying the `hello.py` script, ensuring all necessary tasks are completed efficiently and effectively.
