Here's a detailed todo list for the 'hello.py' project, organized by category and including priority levels and estimated complexity:

### 1. SETUP TASKS

1. **Project Initialization**
   - [High, Simple] Create a project directory named `project-root`.
   - [High, Simple] Inside `project-root`, create a file named `hello.py`.

2. **Environment Setup**
   - [High, Simple] Ensure Python 3.x is installed on the development machine.
   - [High, Simple] Verify the Python installation by running `python --version` in the terminal.

3. **Dependencies Installation**
   - [Low, Simple] Confirm no external dependencies are required for this project.

### 2. CORE IMPLEMENTATION TASKS

1. **Console Output Component**
   - [High, Simple] Implement the function to print "Hello, World!" to the console using Python's `print()` function in `hello.py`.

2. **File Output Component**
   - [High, Simple] Implement the functionality to create a text file named `output.txt` in the same directory.
   - [High, Simple] Write the message "Hello, World!" to `output.txt` using Python's file handling capabilities (`open()` function with 'w' mode).

### 3. TESTING TASKS

1. **Unit Test Creation**
   - [Medium, Simple] Manually test the console output to verify "Hello, World!" is printed correctly.
   - [Medium, Simple] Manually test the creation and content of `output.txt` to ensure it contains the correct message.

2. **Integration Test Setup**
   - [Medium, Simple] Verify both components (console and file output) work together seamlessly by running the script end-to-end.

3. **Test Data Preparation**
   - [Low, Simple] No additional test data preparation is needed due to the simplicity of the script.

### 4. DOCUMENTATION TASKS

1. **Code Documentation**
   - [Medium, Simple] Add comments in `hello.py` explaining the purpose of each major section of the code.

2. **User Documentation**
   - [Medium, Simple] Create a simple README file in `project-root` with instructions on how to run the script.

3. **API Documentation**
   - [Low, N/A] Not applicable, as the project does not involve any API interactions.

### 5. DEPLOYMENT TASKS

1. **Configuration Setup**
   - [Low, Simple] Ensure the script is configured to run on any system with Python 3.x installed.

2. **Deployment Preparation**
   - [Medium, Simple] Test the script on different operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux) to ensure compatibility.

3. **Production Readiness Checks**
   - [Medium, Simple] Confirm that the script meets all acceptance criteria and performs as expected without errors.

This todo list provides a structured approach to completing the 'hello.py' project, ensuring all tasks are prioritized and clearly defined for efficient execution.
