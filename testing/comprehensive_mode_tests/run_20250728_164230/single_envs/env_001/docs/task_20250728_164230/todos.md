# Project Tasks

## Project Setup & Core Architecture
- [ ] Create project directory structure
  - Set up the calculator/ directory with proper Python package structure including __init__.py files in root and tests/ directories
- [ ] Initialize operations.py module
  - Create operations.py file with proper module docstring and import statements, establishing the business logic layer foundation
- [ ] Set up package metadata (can work in parallel)
  - Create __init__.py files in both calculator/ and tests/ directories, add __version__ = "1.0.0" to root __init__.py

## Core Arithmetic Operations
- [ ] Implement add function (can work in parallel)
  - Create add(a: float, b: float) -> float function in operations.py with proper type hints and docstring
- [ ] Implement subtract function (can work in parallel)
  - Create subtract(a: float, b: float) -> float function in operations.py with proper type hints and docstring
- [ ] Implement multiply function (can work in parallel)
  - Create multiply(a: float, b: float) -> float function in operations.py with proper type hints and docstring
- [ ] Implement divide function (can work in parallel)
  - Create divide(a: float, b: float) -> float function in operations.py with proper type hints, docstring, and ValueError handling for division by zero

## Unit Testing Suite
- [ ] Create test_operations.py structure
  - Set up test_operations.py file with proper imports, TestOperations class inheriting from unittest.TestCase, and basic test structure
- [ ] Write tests for add function (can work in parallel)
  - Create comprehensive test cases for add function including positive, negative, zero, large numbers, and floating-point precision tests
- [ ] Write tests for subtract function (can work in parallel)
  - Create comprehensive test cases for subtract function including edge cases and precision validation
- [ ] Write tests for multiply function (can work in parallel)
  - Create comprehensive test cases for multiply function including commutative property tests and edge cases
- [ ] Write tests for divide function (can work in parallel)
  - Create comprehensive test cases for divide function including normal cases, division by zero error handling, and precision tests
- [ ] Verify 100% test coverage
  - Run tests with coverage tool to ensure 100% coverage of operations.py and fix any gaps

## CLI Interface & User Interaction
- [ ] Create calculator.py main structure
  - Set up calculator.py with main() function, welcome banner, and basic CLI loop structure including KeyboardInterrupt handling
- [ ] Implement parse_number function (can work in parallel)
  - Create parse_number(prompt: str) -> float function that handles user input validation and re-prompting for numeric values
- [ ] Implement parse_operator function (can work in parallel)
  - Create parse_operator(prompt: str) -> str function that validates operator input (+, -, *, /) and handles re-prompting
- [ ] Implement format_result function (can work in parallel)
  - Create format_result(value: float) -> str function that formats results with 10 decimal places or scientific notation as needed
- [ ] Implement calculation dispatch logic (can work in parallel)
  - Create the logic to dispatch to appropriate operation based on user input and handle division by zero errors gracefully
- [ ] Implement continue/exit prompt (can work in parallel)
  - Add the logic to ask users if they want to perform another calculation or exit after each operation

## Quality Assurance & Final Polish
- [ ] Manual testing verification
  - Perform end-to-end manual testing with at least 10 distinct input cases covering all four operations and edge cases
- [ ] PEP 8 compliance check (can work in parallel)
  - Run flake8 or similar linter to ensure all code follows PEP 8 standards with max-line-length=88
- [ ] Documentation review (can work in parallel)
  - Review all docstrings for completeness and accuracy, ensure all public functions have proper documentation
- [ ] Final integration test
  - Clone the repository in a fresh environment and verify that all tests pass and the calculator works without additional setup
