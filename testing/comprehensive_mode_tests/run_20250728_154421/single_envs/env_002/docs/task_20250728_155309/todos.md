# Project Tasks

## File I/O & Infrastructure
- [ ] Create project directory structure
  - Set up the complete project directory structure as outlined in design.md including src/, tests/, scripts/, and fixtures/ directories
- [ ] Implement FileManager class
  - Create src/file_manager.py with read_file() and write_file() methods that handle UTF-8 file operations with atomic writes and proper error handling
- [ ] Create requirements.txt (can work in parallel)
  - Create requirements.txt with necessary Python dependencies (likely just standard library, but include any testing frameworks like pytest)
- [ ] Set up logging configuration (can work in parallel)
  - Create src/logger.py with basic logging configuration that prints to stdout as required by FR-3

## Parser Module
- [ ] Implement TodoParser class
  - Create src/parser.py with TodoParser class that can parse todos.md and identify open todos using regex pattern for - [ ] lines
- [ ] Add line number tracking
  - Enhance parser to track line numbers for each identified todo to enable precise file updates
- [ ] Handle edge cases (can work in parallel)
  - Add handling for malformed todo lines, empty files, and files with no open todos
- [ ] Create parser unit tests (can work in parallel)
  - Create comprehensive unit tests in tests/test_parser.py including test fixtures for various todo formats

## Executor Module
- [ ] Create TodoExecutor class
  - Implement src/executor.py with TodoExecutor class that can execute todo-specific logic based on todo text content
- [ ] Implement todo-to-action mapping
  - Create a mapping system that converts todo text descriptions into executable actions (may need to implement basic actions for common todo types)
- [ ] Add execution logging (can work in parallel)
  - Implement logging to stdout for each completed todo as required by FR-3
- [ ] Create executor unit tests (can work in parallel)
  - Create tests in tests/test_executor.py to verify todo execution and logging behavior

## Integration & Testing
- [ ] Create main controller
  - Implement src/main.py that orchestrates the entire process: initialize components, parse todos, execute first 3, update file, and report results
- [ ] Create sample todos.md (can work in parallel)
  - Create a sample todos.md file with at least 3 open todos for testing purposes
- [ ] Create integration tests (can work in parallel)
  - Create integration tests that verify the complete workflow from reading todos.md to updating it with completed tasks
- [ ] Create run script (can work in parallel)
  - Create scripts/run.sh convenience script to execute the todo processor
- [ ] Add error handling validation (can work in parallel)
  - Test and validate error handling for missing files, insufficient todos, and file write failures

## Documentation & Deployment
- [ ] Create README.md (can work in parallel)
  - Write comprehensive README.md with usage instructions, installation steps, and examples
- [ ] Create setup.py (can work in parallel)
  - Create setup.py for package distribution and installation
- [ ] Add usage documentation (can work in parallel)
  - Document how to use the todo processor including command-line usage and configuration options
- [ ] Final validation
  - Run complete validation against all requirements and success criteria to ensure the system works as expected
