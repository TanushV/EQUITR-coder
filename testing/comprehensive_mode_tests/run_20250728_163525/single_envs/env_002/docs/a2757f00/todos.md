# Project Tasks

## Discovery & Parsing Infrastructure
- [ ] Implement File Scanner with Glob Patterns
  - Create a recursive file scanner that can traverse the project directory and identify files matching supported extensions (*.py, *.js, *.ts, *.md, *.txt, *.json, *.yaml, *.yml). Include filtering for common ignore patterns like node_modules, .git, __pycache__, etc.
- [ ] Create Regex Pattern Library for TODO Extraction (can work in parallel)
  - Implement comprehensive regex patterns for each file type to extract TODO items. Patterns should match: # TODO:, // TODO:, /* TODO: */, <!-- TODO: -->, [ ] checkboxes, and variations with different delimiters.
- [ ] Build TodoItem Data Structure
  - Create the TodoItem class with fields: file_path (str), line_number (int), content (str), type (str - 'comment', 'checkbox', etc.), description (str), status ('pending' | 'completed' | 'failed'). Include validation and serialization methods.
- [ ] Implement TodoExtractor Integration
  - Combine the file scanner and regex parsers into a unified TodoExtractor class that produces a list of TodoItem objects. Include error handling for file access issues and malformed TODO formats.

## Processing & Action Engine
- [ ] Create Deterministic Sorter
  - Implement sorting algorithm that orders TODOs by file path (alphabetical ascending) and then by line number (ascending). This ensures consistent processing order across runs.
- [ ] Build Action Parser & Command Mapper (can work in parallel)
  - Create a parser that reads TODO descriptions and maps them to specific action types. Include common patterns like 'refactor', 'add test', 'update docs', 'fix bug', etc. with appropriate handlers.
- [ ] Implement Action Handlers (can work in parallel)
  - Create specific action handlers for common TODO types: code refactoring (extract method, rename variable), documentation updates (add docstrings, update README), configuration changes (update JSON/YAML), and test additions (create test files, add assertions).
- [ ] Create Tool Integration Wrapper
  - Build a wrapper around the update_todo tool with retry logic (3 attempts with exponential backoff), error handling, and logging. Include validation of tool responses and graceful degradation on failures.

## Verification & Reporting System
- [ ] Implement Final Verification Scanner
  - Create a post-processing verification system that re-runs the discovery engine after all TODOs are processed to ensure zero TODOs remain. Include comparison with original TODO list to detect any missed items.
- [ ] Build Report Generator
  - Create a markdown report generator that produces a comprehensive summary including: total TODOs processed, success/failure counts, detailed list of completed items with file paths and descriptions, and any failures with error messages and stack traces.
- [ ] Create Progress Tracking System
  - Implement real-time progress tracking with console output showing current TODO being processed, completion percentage, and estimated time remaining. Include both verbose and quiet modes.

## Main Orchestration & Testing
- [ ] Create Main Processor Class
  - Build the central orchestrator class that coordinates the entire pipeline: discovery → sorting → processing → verification → reporting. Include proper error handling and logging throughout the flow.
- [ ] Implement Comprehensive Logging (can work in parallel)
  - Create a centralized logging system with different levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR) that writes to both console and file (logs/processing.log). Include structured logging for TODO processing events and tool interactions.
- [ ] Create Test Fixtures & Sample Data (can work in parallel)
  - Build test fixtures including sample files with various TODO formats across different file types. Create unit tests for each component (discovery, parsing, sorting, action execution) with mock data and edge cases.
- [ ] Implement Error Handling & Recovery
  - Create comprehensive error handling for file access issues, malformed TODOs, action execution failures, and tool communication problems. Include graceful degradation where processing continues even if individual TODOs fail.

## Project Setup & Configuration
- [ ] Initialize Project Structure
  - Create the complete directory structure: src/ with subdirectories (discovery, models, processing, verification, utils), tests/ with fixtures, logs/, and reports/. Create __init__.py files for all Python packages.
- [ ] Create Requirements and Setup Files (can work in parallel)
  - Generate requirements.txt with necessary dependencies (pytest for testing, pathlib for file operations, logging for structured logging). Create setup.py or pyproject.toml for package installation.
- [ ] Write README and Documentation (can work in parallel)
  - Create comprehensive README.md with project description, installation instructions, usage examples, and architecture overview. Include documentation for extending with new file types or action handlers.
