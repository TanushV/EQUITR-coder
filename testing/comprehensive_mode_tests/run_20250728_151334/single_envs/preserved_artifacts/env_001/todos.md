# Project Tasks

## Core Operations & Exceptions
- [ ] Create custom exceptions module
  - Implement DivisionByZeroError and InvalidInputError exception classes in exceptions.py with proper inheritance and docstrings
- [ ] Implement arithmetic operations module
  - Create operations.py with add, subtract, multiply, and divide functions including type hints, docstrings, and division by zero handling
- [ ] Write unit tests for operations (can work in parallel)
  - Create test_operations.py with comprehensive tests for all four arithmetic operations, edge cases, and error scenarios to achieve 100% coverage

## Input Handling & Validation
- [ ] Create input handler module
  - Implement input_handler.py with get_number function for user input, validate_number for input validation, and parse_scientific_notation for scientific notation support
- [ ] Implement input validation logic (can work in parallel)
  - Add comprehensive input validation including numeric format checking, length limits (50 chars), and handling of various number formats (int, float, scientific notation)
- [ ] Write unit tests for input handler (can work in parallel)
  - Create test_input_handler.py with tests for valid inputs, invalid inputs, scientific notation parsing, boundary values, and error handling to achieve 100% coverage

## CLI Interface & Integration
- [ ] Create CLI entry point
  - Implement calculator.py with main function, display_menu for operation choices, get_operation_choice for user selection, and run_calculator_loop for main application flow
- [ ] Implement graceful exit handling (can work in parallel)
  - Add KeyboardInterrupt handling (Ctrl+C) and clean exit functionality with proper goodbye message when user selects exit option
- [ ] Write integration tests (can work in parallel)
  - Create test_integration.py with end-to-end tests for complete CLI workflows, error recovery scenarios, menu navigation, and exit behavior testing

## Project Setup & Quality Assurance
- [ ] Set up project structure
  - Create directory structure (calculator/, tests/, tests/fixtures/), initialize git repository, create .gitignore, .flake8 config, and empty requirements.txt
- [ ] Create test fixtures and data (can work in parallel)
  - Create test data files in tests/fixtures/ including valid_numbers.txt and invalid_inputs.txt for comprehensive testing scenarios
- [ ] Write comprehensive README (can work in parallel)
  - Create README.md with installation instructions, usage examples, project description, and all necessary documentation for users
- [ ] Code quality and linting (can work in parallel)
  - Run flake8 across all Python files, fix any linting issues, ensure all public functions have Google-style docstrings, and verify PEP 8 compliance
