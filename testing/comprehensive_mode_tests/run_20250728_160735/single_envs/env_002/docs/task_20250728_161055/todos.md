# Project Tasks

## Core Operations Implementation
- [ ] Create operations.py module with arithmetic functions
  - Implement the four core arithmetic operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide) as pure functions with type hints and docstrings. Each function should accept two float parameters and return a float result.
- [ ] Implement comprehensive unit tests for operations (can work in parallel)
  - Create test_operations.py with test cases covering positive numbers, negative numbers, zero values, floating-point precision, and edge cases. Ensure 100% code coverage for the operations module.
- [ ] Add edge case handling for operations (can work in parallel)
  - Test and handle edge cases like very large numbers, floating-point precision issues, and boundary conditions in the arithmetic operations.

## Input Validation System
- [ ] Create validators.py module with input validation functions
  - Implement validate_number() to convert string inputs to floats with proper error handling, and validate_non_zero() to check for division by zero. Include comprehensive docstrings and type hints.
- [ ] Implement unit tests for validation functions (can work in parallel)
  - Create test_validators.py with test cases for valid numeric strings, invalid strings (letters, special characters), edge cases like empty strings, and zero/non-zero validation scenarios.
- [ ] Test validation edge cases and error messages (can work in parallel)
  - Ensure validation functions provide clear, user-friendly error messages and handle all edge cases like whitespace, scientific notation, and extreme values.

## CLI Interface Development
- [ ] Create calculator.py main CLI entry point
  - Implement the main CLI application with interactive menu system, user input flow, and coordination between components. Include proper error handling and graceful exit functionality.
- [ ] Implement menu display and user interaction flow (can work in parallel)
  - Create the interactive menu system that displays options 1-5, handles user choice selection, and provides clear prompts for number input. Ensure proper formatting and user experience.
- [ ] Add keyboard interrupt handling (Ctrl+C) (can work in parallel)
  - Implement graceful handling of KeyboardInterrupt exceptions to ensure the program exits cleanly when user presses Ctrl+C, displaying 'Goodbye!' message.

## Integration Testing & Quality Assurance
- [ ] Create integration tests for complete CLI flows
  - Implement test_integration.py with end-to-end tests covering complete user interaction flows, including menu navigation, calculation cycles, and error scenarios using unittest.mock for input simulation.
- [ ] Set up test infrastructure and coverage reporting (can work in parallel)
  - Configure the test environment with proper directory structure, __init__.py files, and coverage reporting setup. Ensure tests can be run with 'python -m unittest discover tests'.
- [ ] Perform final quality checks and documentation (can work in parallel)
  - Run complete test suite, verify 100% coverage for core modules, check code style with pylint, and create comprehensive README.md with usage instructions and examples.

## Project Setup & Configuration
- [ ] Initialize project structure and files
  - Create the complete project directory structure with calculator/, tests/ subdirectory, and all required files (__init__.py, .gitignore, .pylintrc, requirements.txt, README.md).
- [ ] Configure development environment (can work in parallel)
  - Set up Python environment configuration files including .gitignore for Python projects, empty requirements.txt (standard library only), and basic pylint configuration for code quality checks.
- [ ] Create initial documentation and setup instructions (can work in parallel)
  - Write comprehensive README.md with project description, installation instructions, usage examples, testing commands, and project structure overview.
