## 1. Project Overview
The user wants to systematically process and complete every outstanding TODO item in an existing project. The work must be done sequentially, one TODO at a time, and each TODO must be explicitly marked as completed using the `update_todo` tool once it is finished.

## 2. Functional Requirements
- **Enumerate TODOs**: Identify every TODO item currently tracked in the project.
- **Sequential Processing**: Work through the TODO list in a defined order (e.g., file order, priority, or creation date).
- **Completion Tracking**: After finishing each TODO, invoke `update_todo` with the TODO’s unique identifier and a status of “completed”.
- **No Skipping**: Every TODO must be addressed; none may be left incomplete or ignored.
- **Audit Trail**: Maintain a running log (in stdout or a file) that records:
  - TODO identifier
  - Description of the TODO
  - Timestamp when work started
  - Timestamp when work finished
  - Confirmation that `update_todo` was called

## 3. Technical Requirements
- **Tool Availability**: Ensure the `update_todo` CLI tool or API endpoint is accessible and authenticated.
- **TODO Source**: Parse the project’s TODO list from its canonical source (e.g., `TODO.md`, issue tracker, or inline code comments with a specific tag).
- **Execution Environment**: Run in an environment that has:
  - Read access to the project source
  - Write access to the TODO tracking system
  - Network access if `update_todo` is remote
- **Error Handling**: If a TODO cannot be completed (e.g., blocked dependency), log the blocker and continue to the next TODO; do not halt the entire process.
- **Idempotency**: If the script is re-run, it should skip TODOs already marked completed.

## 4. Success Criteria
- **Zero Remaining TODOs**: After execution, querying the project’s TODO list returns an empty set.
- **Completion Log**: A timestamped log file exists showing every TODO that was processed and the exact time `update_todo` was invoked for each.
- **Verification Script**: A simple script or command (e.g., `grep -r "TODO"` or equivalent) confirms no uncompleted TODOs remain in the codebase or documentation.
- **Exit Code**: The process exits with code `0` only if all TODOs were successfully completed; otherwise, it exits with a non-zero code indicating the number of TODOs left incomplete.
