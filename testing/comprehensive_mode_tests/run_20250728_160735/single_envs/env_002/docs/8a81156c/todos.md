# Project Tasks

## Foundation & Setup
- [ ] Create project directory structure
  - Set up the complete directory structure as defined in design.md including src/, config/, scripts/, tests/, logs/ directories with proper __init__.py files
- [ ] Implement TODOItem data model
  - Create the TODOItem class in src/models/todo.py with all required attributes (id, description, file_path, line_number, priority, tags, created_date, status) and TODOStatus enum
- [ ] Set up configuration management system
  - Create config/system.yaml with all required settings and implement configuration loader in src/utils/ to read and validate YAML configuration
- [ ] Create basic logging infrastructure
  - Implement the AuditLogger class in src/logging/audit_logger.py with methods for structured logging, completion tracking, and audit trail maintenance

## TODO Discovery System
- [ ] Implement inline comment TODO discovery (can work in parallel)
  - Create todo_finder.py with functionality to scan .py, .js, .ts, .md files for TODO:, FIXME:, HACK: patterns and extract TODO items with metadata
- [ ] Implement markdown file TODO discovery (can work in parallel)
  - Add support for parsing TODO.md files and extracting TODO items from markdown format with proper metadata extraction
- [ ] Create metadata extraction utilities (can work in parallel)
  - Implement utilities to extract priority, tags, and creation date from TODO text descriptions using regex patterns
- [ ] Add unit tests for discovery components
  - Create comprehensive unit tests for TODO discovery functionality including edge cases and error handling

## Processing Engine
- [ ] Implement sorting strategies
  - Create sorters.py with multiple sorting strategies (priority, file_order, creation_date) for ordering TODO items during processing
- [ ] Build processing orchestrator
  - Implement the TODOProcessor class in engine.py with methods for loading, sorting, and processing TODOs sequentially with proper state management
- [ ] Add error handling and recovery
  - Implement comprehensive error handling for blocked TODOs, network failures, and processing errors with retry logic and graceful degradation
- [ ] Create state persistence system
  - Build system to persist processing state to disk, allowing idempotent re-runs that skip already completed TODOs

## Update Service Integration
- [ ] Implement CLI adapter for update_todo (can work in parallel)
  - Create CLI adapter in update_adapter.py that interfaces with local update_todo command-line tool with proper error handling and retry logic
- [ ] Implement API adapter for update_todo (can work in parallel)
  - Create REST API adapter for remote update_todo service with authentication, health checks, and network error handling
- [ ] Add health check functionality (can work in parallel)
  - Implement health_checker.py to verify update_todo service availability before processing begins and during runtime
- [ ] Create service abstraction layer
  - Build factory pattern to dynamically select between CLI and API adapters based on configuration

## Verification & Deployment
- [ ] Create verification script
  - Implement verify_todos.sh script that confirms zero remaining TODOs after processing using grep or equivalent tools
- [ ] Build progress reporting system
  - Create real-time progress reporting showing current TODO being processed, completion percentage, and estimated time remaining
- [ ] Create Docker containerization
  - Write Dockerfile with all dependencies, environment setup, and proper entry point for containerized deployment
- [ ] Write deployment scripts
  - Create deploy.sh script for automated deployment including environment setup, configuration validation, and service health checks

## Testing & Documentation
- [ ] Create comprehensive unit tests (can work in parallel)
  - Write unit tests for all components including discovery, processing, update adapters, and logging with >80% code coverage
- [ ] Build integration test suite (can work in parallel)
  - Create end-to-end integration tests that verify complete workflow from discovery through completion tracking
- [ ] Write user documentation (can work in parallel)
  - Create comprehensive README.md with installation, configuration, usage examples, and troubleshooting guide
- [ ] Create performance benchmarks
  - Implement performance testing to measure processing speed for different TODO list sizes and optimize bottlenecks
