# Project Tasks

## Project Setup & Foundation
- [ ] Initialize project structure and repository
  - Create the todo-completer directory structure with src/, tests/, and root files (requirements.txt, setup.py, README.md). Set up git repository and initial commit.
- [ ] Create configuration system (can work in parallel)
  - Implement .todocompleter.yml configuration file support with scan patterns, exclude directories, and rescan interval settings. Create default configuration and validation.
- [ ] Set up development environment (can work in parallel)
  - Create requirements.txt with necessary dependencies (pytest, pyyaml, etc.). Set up virtual environment and development scripts. Create basic Makefile or setup.py for installation.
- [ ] Create basic CLI entry point (can work in parallel)
  - Implement main.py with argument parsing (--help, --config, --verbose flags) and basic orchestration structure. Add proper exit codes and error handling.

## Scanner Module Implementation
- [ ] Implement file system traversal
  - Create recursive directory scanner that respects .gitignore and exclude patterns. Handle symlinks and permission errors gracefully. Return list of all files to scan.
- [ ] Build TODO pattern matching engine (can work in parallel)
  - Implement regex patterns for TODO, FIXME, HACK, @todo with case-insensitive matching. Extract TODO content and metadata. Handle multiline TODO comments.
- [ ] Create TODO object structure (can work in parallel)
  - Define TODO dataclass with id (file:line), file path, line number, content, type, and status. Implement serialization/deserialization methods.
- [ ] Implement sorting and deduplication (can work in parallel)
  - Sort TODOs by file path then line number for deterministic processing. Handle duplicate TODOs at same location. Create stable unique identifiers.
- [ ] Add comprehensive scanner tests (can work in parallel)
  - Write unit tests for scanner.py including edge cases (empty files, binary files, unicode content, very long lines). Create test fixtures with sample projects.

## Processor Module Implementation
- [ ] Implement TODO queue management
  - Create in-memory queue for open TODOs with thread-safe operations. Implement methods for adding, removing, and checking queue status. Handle queue persistence between rescans.
- [ ] Build update_todo integration (can work in parallel)
  - Create interface for calling update_todo tool with proper error handling and retry logic. Handle tool not found or permission errors. Implement dry-run mode.
- [ ] Implement logging system (can work in parallel)
  - Create todo_completion.log writer with ISO timestamp format, unique ID tracking, and file rotation. Ensure atomic writes and handle disk full errors.
- [ ] Add re-scan trigger mechanism (can work in parallel)
  - Implement counter for completed TODOs with configurable re-scan interval. Trigger scanner re-run after N completions and merge new TODOs into queue.
- [ ] Create progress reporting (can work in parallel)
  - Implement real-time progress display showing current TODO being processed, completion count, and estimated remaining time. Add verbose and quiet modes.

## Validator Module Implementation
- [ ] Implement duplicate detection
  - Create validator that checks todo_completion.log for duplicate TODO IDs. Implement efficient lookup using sets or bloom filters. Report duplicates with line numbers.
- [ ] Build final scan verification (can work in parallel)
  - Implement final validation scan that confirms zero open TODOs remain. Compare against log file to ensure no TODOs were missed. Generate validation report.
- [ ] Create integrity checks (can work in parallel)
  - Verify all logged TODOs actually exist in source files. Check for log file corruption or incomplete entries. Implement repair mechanism for damaged logs.
- [ ] Add exit condition validation (can work in parallel)
  - Implement final checks before process exit: zero TODOs, no duplicates, clean log file. Set appropriate exit codes (0 for success, non-zero for errors).

## Testing & Edge Case Handling
- [ ] Create comprehensive test suite
  - Write integration tests covering full workflow from discovery to validation. Test with various project sizes and structures. Include performance benchmarks.
- [ ] Implement edge case handlers (can work in parallel)
  - Handle obsolete TODOs (code removed but TODO remains), permission denied files, network filesystem issues, and concurrent file modifications during processing.
- [ ] Add performance optimization (can work in parallel)
  - Implement caching for file hashes to avoid re-scanning unchanged files. Add parallel file reading for large projects. Optimize regex patterns for speed.
- [ ] Create documentation and examples (can work in parallel)
  - Write comprehensive README with usage examples, configuration options, and troubleshooting guide. Create sample projects demonstrating different TODO patterns.

## Deployment & Distribution
- [ ] Create distribution package
  - Set up setup.py with proper metadata, entry points, and dependencies. Create PyPI-ready package structure. Add version management and changelog.
- [ ] Build CLI tool wrapper (can work in parallel)
  - Create update_todo.sh shell script wrapper for the Python tool. Ensure cross-platform compatibility (Windows batch file equivalent). Add to system PATH.
- [ ] Add CI/CD pipeline (can work in parallel)
  - Set up GitHub Actions for automated testing on multiple Python versions and OS platforms. Add code coverage reporting and automatic PyPI publishing on releases.
- [ ] Create installation scripts (can work in parallel)
  - Write one-line installation script for Unix systems. Create Homebrew formula and Chocolatey package for easy installation. Add Docker image for containerized usage.
