## 1. Project Overview
The user wants to systematically process and complete every open TODO item in the current project.  
The work must be done **one TODO at a time**, and each TODO must be explicitly marked as **completed** using the `update_todo` tool after it is finished.

## 2. Functional Requirements
| ID | Requirement | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| FR-1 | **Discover all TODOs** | Scan the entire project (source files, README, docs, scripts, etc.) and compile a complete list of every open TODO item. |
| FR-2 | **Prioritize TODOs** | Establish a deterministic order (e.g., alphabetical by file path, then line number) so the list is processed consistently. |
| FR-3 | **Process one TODO at a time** | Work on exactly one TODO before moving to the next. |
| FR-4 | **Mark TODO as completed** | After finishing the work for a TODO, invoke `update_todo` with the TODO’s unique identifier and status `completed`. |
| FR-5 | **Provide progress updates** | After each TODO is completed, emit a concise message: `TODO <id> completed: <short description>`. |
| FR-6 | **Handle edge cases** | If a TODO is no longer relevant (e.g., code removed), mark it `completed` with a note “obsolete”. |
| FR-7 | **Terminate when none remain** | Stop only when the scan returns zero open TODOs. |

## 3. Technical Requirements
| ID | Requirement | Details |
|---|---|---|
| TR-1 | **Scanning mechanism** | Use a recursive file search (e.g., `grep -r "TODO"` or AST-based parser) to locate all `TODO`, `FIXME`, `HACK`, or `@todo` comments. |
| TR-2 | **Unique TODO identifier** | Each TODO must have a stable ID: `<relative-file-path>:<line-number>`. |
| TR-3 | **update_todo tool** | The tool must accept two parameters: `id` (string) and `status` (string: `completed`). |
| TR-4 | **State persistence** | Maintain an in-memory list of open TODOs; no external database required. |
| TR-5 | **Logging** | Append each completion event to a simple log file `todo_completion.log` in the project root: `<ISO-timestamp> - <id> - completed`. |
| TR-6 | **Re-scan safeguard** | After every 10 TODOs completed, re-scan to catch any newly introduced TODOs before continuing. |

## 4. Success Criteria
- **SC-1** A final scan reports zero open TODOs.  
- **SC-2** Every line in `todo_completion.log` shows a unique TODO marked `completed`.  
- **SC-3** No TODO appears in the log more than once.  
- **SC-4** The process exits with code `0` only when SC-1 is true.
