# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a comprehensive testing framework for the EquitrCoder system to validate different agent configurations and workflows. The testing will cover single agent mode, multi-agent without parallelization, and multi-agent with parallelization, all using the moonshot/kimi-k2-0711-preview model. Each test scenario will be isolated in separate testing folders and will validate document creation, todo completion, agent execution, and audit functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to test single agent functionality in isolation, so that I can verify the core agent behavior works correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a single agent test is executed THEN the system SHALL create a dedicated testing folder for single agent scenarios
2. WHEN the single agent is configured THEN the system SHALL use moonshot/kimi-k2-0711-preview as the model
3. WHEN document creation is tested THEN the system SHALL verify that documents are properly generated and formatted
4. WHEN todo completion is tested THEN the system SHALL verify that tasks are marked as completed appropriately
5. WHEN agent execution is tested THEN the system SHALL verify that the agent runs without errors and produces expected outputs
6. WHEN audit functionality is tested THEN the system SHALL verify that audit logs are generated and contain relevant information

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to test multi-agent functionality without parallelization, so that I can verify sequential multi-agent coordination works correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a multi-agent non-parallel test is executed THEN the system SHALL create a dedicated testing folder for this scenario
2. WHEN multiple agents are configured THEN the system SHALL ensure all agents use moonshot/kimi-k2-0711-preview as the model
3. WHEN agents execute sequentially THEN the system SHALL verify that agent coordination happens in the correct order
4. WHEN document creation is tested THEN the system SHALL verify that multiple agents can collaborate on document generation
5. WHEN todo completion is tested THEN the system SHALL verify that tasks are properly distributed and completed across agents
6. WHEN agent execution is tested THEN the system SHALL verify that all agents run successfully and communicate effectively
7. WHEN audit functionality is tested THEN the system SHALL verify that audit trails capture multi-agent interactions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to test multi-agent functionality with parallelization, so that I can verify concurrent multi-agent execution works correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a multi-agent parallel test is executed THEN the system SHALL create a dedicated testing folder for this scenario
2. WHEN multiple agents are configured for parallel execution THEN the system SHALL ensure all agents use moonshot/kimi-k2-0711-preview as the model
3. WHEN agents execute in parallel THEN the system SHALL verify that concurrent execution doesn't cause conflicts or race conditions
4. WHEN document creation is tested THEN the system SHALL verify that parallel agents can safely create and modify documents
5. WHEN todo completion is tested THEN the system SHALL verify that parallel task execution works without conflicts
6. WHEN agent execution is tested THEN the system SHALL verify that all parallel agents complete successfully
7. WHEN audit functionality is tested THEN the system SHALL verify that audit logs properly capture parallel agent activities

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error reporting and root cause analysis, so that I can quickly identify and fix issues in different agent configurations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any test fails THEN the system SHALL capture detailed error information including stack traces
2. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide root cause analysis explaining why the error happened
3. WHEN tests complete THEN the system SHALL generate a comprehensive report of all results
4. WHEN multiple test scenarios are run THEN the system SHALL compare results across different configurations
5. IF any configuration fails THEN the system SHALL isolate the failure to prevent it from affecting other tests
6. WHEN reporting results THEN the system SHALL include performance metrics and execution times for each scenario

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want isolated test environments, so that different test scenarios don't interfere with each other.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN test folders are created THEN the system SHALL ensure each scenario has a completely separate directory structure
2. WHEN tests are executed THEN the system SHALL prevent cross-contamination between different test scenarios
3. WHEN configuration is applied THEN the system SHALL ensure each test uses its own configuration settings
4. WHEN cleanup is performed THEN the system SHALL properly clean up resources after each test scenario
5. IF one test scenario fails THEN the system SHALL continue executing other scenarios without interruption
