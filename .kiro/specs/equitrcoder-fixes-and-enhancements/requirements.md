# EQUITR Coder Fixes and Enhancements - Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines the comprehensive fixes and enhancements needed for the EQUITR Coder project based on the audit findings. The project aims to resolve critical issues, improve production readiness, and add long-term enhancements while ensuring full functionality across all interfaces (programmatic, TUI, CLI).

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Critical Bug Fixes

**User Story:** As a developer using EQUITR Coder, I want all convenience functions and test files to work correctly so that I can use the library without runtime errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

2. WHEN I run the test files THEN all tests SHALL pass without TypeError exceptions
3. WHEN I use any convenience function THEN the system SHALL properly validate and pass all required parameters
4. IF a required parameter is missing THEN the system SHALL provide a clear error message with usage examples
5. WHEN I import any module THEN the system SHALL load without import errors

### Requirement 2: CLI and Installation Improvements

**User Story:** As a user, I want to install EQUITR Coder and access it via command line easily so that I can use it without complex setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I install the package THEN the system SHALL register console script entry points
2. WHEN I run `equitrcoder --help` from command line THEN the system SHALL display help information
3. WHEN I use pip install THEN the system SHALL install all required dependencies correctly
4. WHEN I run CLI commands THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages for missing API keys or invalid parameters

### Requirement 3: Production Readiness Features

**User Story:** As a production user, I want robust error handling, model validation, and comprehensive testing so that the system works reliably in production environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I specify a model THEN the system SHALL validate model availability before execution
2. WHEN an API key is missing THEN the system SHALL provide specific instructions for setting it up
3. WHEN I run integration tests THEN the system SHALL test all major workflows end-to-end
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide actionable error messages with suggested solutions
5. WHEN I check system status THEN the system SHALL report model availability and API key status

### Requirement 4: Enhanced Model Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want sophisticated model selection, cost estimation, and performance monitoring so that I can optimize my AI coding workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I request model selection THEN the system SHALL show available models with cost estimates
2. WHEN I execute tasks THEN the system SHALL track and report performance metrics
3. WHEN I configure models THEN the system SHALL validate compatibility and function calling support
4. WHEN I monitor costs THEN the system SHALL provide real-time cost tracking and budget alerts
5. WHEN I analyze performance THEN the system SHALL provide execution time, token usage, and success rate metrics

### Requirement 5: CI/CD Pipeline

**User Story:** As a maintainer, I want automated testing and deployment so that every commit is validated and releases are reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is pushed to GitHub THEN the system SHALL run all tests automatically
2. WHEN tests pass THEN the system SHALL run linting and code quality checks
3. WHEN pull requests are created THEN the system SHALL run comprehensive test suites
4. WHEN releases are tagged THEN the system SHALL automatically build and publish packages
5. WHEN tests fail THEN the system SHALL provide clear feedback on what needs to be fixed

### Requirement 6: Documentation Updates

**User Story:** As a user, I want comprehensive and up-to-date documentation so that I can understand how to use all features effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I read the README THEN the system SHALL provide accurate installation and usage instructions
2. WHEN I look for examples THEN the system SHALL include working code samples for all major features
3. WHEN I need troubleshooting help THEN the system SHALL provide common issues and solutions
4. WHEN I want to contribute THEN the system SHALL include clear development setup instructions
5. WHEN new features are added THEN the system SHALL update documentation accordingly

### Requirement 7: Comprehensive Testing Suite

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive tests covering all functionality so that I can confidently make changes and ensure reliability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run unit tests THEN the system SHALL test all individual components
2. WHEN I run integration tests THEN the system SHALL test complete workflows
3. WHEN I run performance tests THEN the system SHALL validate response times and resource usage
4. WHEN I run security tests THEN the system SHALL validate file access restrictions and input validation
5. WHEN I run compatibility tests THEN the system SHALL validate functionality across different Python versions

### Requirement 8: Enhanced Error Handling and User Experience

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear error messages and helpful guidance so that I can quickly resolve issues and be productive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuration is invalid THEN the system SHALL provide specific correction instructions
2. WHEN API limits are reached THEN the system SHALL suggest retry strategies or alternative approaches
3. WHEN models are unavailable THEN the system SHALL suggest available alternatives
4. WHEN file permissions are insufficient THEN the system SHALL provide clear permission requirements
5. WHEN network issues occur THEN the system SHALL provide connectivity troubleshooting guidance
