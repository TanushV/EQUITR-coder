#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuration is invalid THEN the system SHALL provide specific correction instructions
2. WHEN API limits are reached THEN the system SHALL suggest retry strategies or alternative approaches
3. WHEN models are unavailable THEN the system SHALL suggest available alternatives
4. WHEN file permissions are insufficient THEN the system SHALL provide clear permission requirements
5. WHEN network issues occur THEN the system SHALL provide connectivity troubleshooting guidance

### Requirement 9: Mandatory 3-Document Workflow

**User Story:** As a developer, I want every task to start with proper planning through requirements, design, and todos documents so that all work is well-structured and auditable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I execute any task THEN the system SHALL create requirements.md, design.md, and todos.md before starting work
2. WHEN using programmatic interface THEN the system SHALL automatically generate all 3 documents without user interaction
3. WHEN using TUI interface THEN the system SHALL engage in interactive discussion to create each document with user input
4. WHEN using CLI interface THEN the system SHALL automatically generate all 3 documents for both single and multi-agent modes
