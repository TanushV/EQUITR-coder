# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements comprehensive testing of EquitrCoder's different operational modes using the moonshot/kimi-k2-0711-preview model. The testing will validate that all core functionalities work properly across single agent, multi-agent sequential, and multi-agent parallel modes, with proper error reporting and root cause analysis for any failures.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to validate that single agent mode works correctly with all core features, so that I can confidently use this mode for simple tasks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN single agent mode is executed THEN the system SHALL create documentation successfully
2. WHEN single agent mode is executed THEN the system SHALL complete todos properly
3. WHEN single agent mode is executed THEN the system SHALL run audit processes correctly
4. WHEN single agent mode encounters errors THEN the system SHALL report detailed root cause analysis
5. WHEN single agent mode is tested THEN the system SHALL use moonshot/kimi-k2-0711-preview model exclusively

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to validate that multi-agent sequential mode works correctly with all core features, so that I can use this mode for complex coordinated tasks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multi-agent sequential mode is executed THEN the system SHALL create documentation successfully across agents
2. WHEN multi-agent sequential mode is executed THEN the system SHALL complete todos properly with agent coordination
3. WHEN multi-agent sequential mode is executed THEN the system SHALL enable proper agent communication
4. WHEN multi-agent sequential mode is executed THEN the system SHALL run audit processes correctly
5. WHEN multi-agent sequential mode encounters errors THEN the system SHALL report detailed root cause analysis
6. WHEN multi-agent sequential mode is tested THEN the system SHALL use moonshot/kimi-k2-0711-preview model exclusively

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to validate that multi-agent parallel mode works correctly with all core features, so that I can use this mode for concurrent task execution.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multi-agent parallel mode is executed THEN the system SHALL create documentation successfully across parallel agents
2. WHEN multi-agent parallel mode is executed THEN the system SHALL complete todos properly with parallel coordination
3. WHEN multi-agent parallel mode is executed THEN the system SHALL enable proper agent communication between parallel agents
4. WHEN multi-agent parallel mode is executed THEN the system SHALL run audit processes correctly in parallel
5. WHEN multi-agent parallel mode encounters errors THEN the system SHALL report detailed root cause analysis
6. WHEN multi-agent parallel mode is tested THEN the system SHALL use moonshot/kimi-k2-0711-preview model exclusively

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want isolated testing environments for each mode, so that test results don't interfere with each other and can be analyzed independently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing is initiated THEN the system SHALL create separate testing folders for each mode
2. WHEN tests are executed THEN the system SHALL isolate each test environment completely
3. WHEN tests complete THEN the system SHALL preserve all test artifacts for analysis
4. WHEN tests fail THEN the system SHALL maintain error logs in isolated environments

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error reporting and root cause analysis, so that I can quickly identify and fix any issues that arise during testing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any test fails THEN the system SHALL capture detailed error information
2. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL perform root cause analysis
3. WHEN testing completes THEN the system SHALL generate a comprehensive report of all results
4. WHEN issues are identified THEN the system SHALL provide actionable recommendations for fixes
5. IF critical issues are found THEN the system SHALL attempt automatic fixes where possible

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all testing to be performed in programmatic mode, so that the tests can be automated and repeated consistently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing is initiated THEN the system SHALL execute all tests programmatically
2. WHEN tests run THEN the system SHALL not require manual intervention
3. WHEN tests complete THEN the system SHALL provide programmatic access to results
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL handle them programmatically with proper logging
