# TUI Guide (Advanced)

Note: Throughout the codebase and examples, we standardize on:
- Short name/title (task_name) via config.description
- Detailed task body entered in the TUI task input (the long prompt)

The advanced TUI provides an interactive interface for running single, multi-agent, and research (ML) workflows.

## Launch

- Default: `equitrcoder tui` (no flags needed)
- Startup screen lets you select Supervisor, Worker, Mode, and enter the first task
- You can switch modes and models in chat via `/set mode <mode>`, `/set supervisor <model>`, `/set worker <model>`

## Layout

- Top: Header showing time, Supervisor, Worker, Mode, and Session Cost
- Left: Todo Progress
- Center: Chat history and agent logs
- Right: Running agents
- Bottom: Slash-command input (`/>`)

## Startup Screen

- Supervisor model: dropdown (populated via LiteLLM `get_valid_models(check_provider_endpoint=True)`)
- Worker model: dropdown (same list)
- Mode: `single`, `multi-parallel`, `multi-seq`, `research`
- First Task: text box; pressing Enter or clicking Start transitions to the main TUI
