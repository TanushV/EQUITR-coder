# Usage Guide

## TUI (Advanced Only)

- Launch advanced TUI:
  - `equitrcoder tui` (no flags needed)
  - Startup screen lets you pick Supervisor, Worker, Mode, and enter your first task
  - In-chat changes via:
    - `/set supervisor <model>`
    - `/set worker <model>`
    - `/set mode <single|multi-parallel|multi-seq|research>`

In research mode, the startup flow is the same; experiments and datasets are handled programmatically.

The TUI will run the full researcher flow and the final Markdown report is generated by the supervisor model automatically.

## CLI

- Single:
  - `equitrcoder single "Implement feature X" --model moonshot/kimi-k2-0711-preview`
- Multi:
  - `equitrcoder multi "Implement system Y" --supervisor-model moonshot/kimi-k2-0711-preview --worker-model moonshot/kimi-k2-0711-preview --workers 3`
- Research (ML only):
  - `equitrcoder research "Evaluate model on dataset" --supervisor-model moonshot/kimi-k2-0711-preview --worker-model moonshot/kimi-k2-0711-preview --workers 3`
  - Team defaults: `ml_researcher,data_engineer,experiment_runner`
  - Supervisor model outputs `research_report.md` in the session docs folder.

## Programmatic

Use `ResearchTaskConfiguration` for ML research mode with optional non-interactive context:

```python
from equitrcoder.programmatic.interface import EquitrCoder, ResearchTaskConfiguration

coder = EquitrCoder(repo_path=".", mode="research")
config = ResearchTaskConfiguration(
  description="Evaluate ABC on DEF",
  supervisor_model="moonshot/kimi-k2-0711-preview",
  worker_model="moonshot/kimi-k2-0711-preview",
  team=["ml_researcher", "data_engineer", "experiment_runner"],
  research_context={
    "datasets": [{"path": "./data", "description": "local dataset"}],
    "experiments": [
      {"name": "baseline", "command": "python train.py --dataset data"},
      {"name": "variant", "command": "python train.py --dataset data --flag"}
    ]
  }
)
result = await coder.execute_task(config.description, config)
```

See also external programmatic example: `examples/research_programmatic_example.py`.

## Security & Sandboxing

- All examples create a unique subfolder under `generated_projects/<name>_<timestamp>` and set the working directory to that folder.
- Built-in file system and shell tools are restricted to the current working directory and cannot escape the project folder.
- Absolute paths and path traversal attempts are blocked. Commands that attempt to change directories outside the sandbox are rejected.
