## 1. Project Overview
Create a minimal, self-contained Python program that prints the text “Hello, World!” to the console when executed.

## 2. Functional Requirements
- **FR-1** The script must output exactly the string `Hello, World!` followed by a newline character.
- **FR-2** The script must terminate immediately after printing the message.
- **FR-3** The script must run successfully with the default Python interpreter on any standard Python 3.x installation (no external dependencies).

## 3. Technical Requirements
- **TR-1** Language: Python 3.x (tested on 3.8+).
- **TR-2** File name: `hello.py`.
- **TR-3** File encoding: UTF-8.
- **TR-4** Shebang line (optional but recommended): `#!/usr/bin/env python3`.
- **TR-5** Code style: PEP 8 compliant.
- **TR-6** No third-party packages or virtual environments required.

## 4. Success Criteria
- **SC-1** Running `python hello.py` from the command line prints `Hello, World!` and exits with status code 0.
- **SC-2** Running `./hello.py` (after `chmod +x`) on Unix-like systems produces the same output.
- **SC-3** The file is ≤ 100 bytes in size (excluding comments).
- **SC-4** Static analysis tools (e.g., `flake8`, `pylint`) report no errors or warnings.
