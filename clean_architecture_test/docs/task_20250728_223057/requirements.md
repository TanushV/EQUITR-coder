## 1. Project Overview
Create a minimal Python program that outputs the text `Hello, World!` to the console. The program must be saved in a single file named `hello.py`.

## 2. Functional Requirements
| ID | Requirement | Acceptance Criteria |
|---|---|---|
| FR-1 | Display greeting | When executed, the program prints exactly `Hello, World!` followed by a newline to standard output. |
| FR-2 | File naming | The source code must reside in a file named `hello.py` located in the project root directory. |
| FR-3 | Execution method | The program must be runnable with the command `python hello.py` from the project root. |

## 3. Technical Requirements
| ID | Requirement | Details |
|---|---|---|
| TR-1 | Language version | Compatible with Python 3.7 or later. |
| TR-2 | Encoding | Source file saved as UTF-8 without BOM. |
| TR-3 | Shebang (optional) | May include `#!/usr/bin/env python3` on the first line for Unix-like systems. |
| TR-4 | No external dependencies | Must use only the Python standard library. |
| TR-5 | Exit code | Program must exit with status code `0` on success. |

## 4. Success Criteria
- [ ] File `hello.py` exists in the project root.
- [ ] Running `python hello.py` from the project root prints:
  ```
  Hello, World!
  ```
- [ ] No additional output, errors, or prompts appear.
- [ ] Exit status is `0` (check with `echo $?` on Unix or `echo %ERRORLEVEL%` on Windows).
